Description: 
  AutoMixReg provides tools for generating synthetic data and fitting 
  mixture models of linear regression using the Expectation-Maximization 
  algorithm. It includes automatic model selection using the Bayesian Information 
  Criterion (BIC), making it ideal for exploratory regression modeling 
  with heterogeneous subpopulations.
